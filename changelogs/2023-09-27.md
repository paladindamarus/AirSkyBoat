 setting mob size correctly per in era videos
 - bugard, worm, and antlion are large sized
 - main nightmare mobs are large sized, with their spawns on aggro being medium sized
 - there is no clear understanding of if the size means anything.  could buff the larger ones to be tougher
 
 increased damage on pitambush to 3x.
 increased damage on dyna tav pit ambush to much more.
 
 added damage to gastric bomb.
 
 put in a temp fix to ensure clusters have the correct animationsubs - all cluster tp moves are based on mob animation sub.
 this is why clusters in ro'maeve that are des dont use most of their tp moves, or the ones they use hit like a wet paper towel.
 
 updated delay for all nightmare mobs
 
 added starlight music on umbral aggro
 
 **todo**
 overall balancing for damage in/out and drops.
